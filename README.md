# Leveraging GPT-4o for Structured Data Extraction in Clinical Trials: Accuracy, Efficiency, and Research Implications
The website for this page (hosting the final PDF report), can be found at [brandonorodriguez.github.io/Leveraging-GPT-4o-for-Structured-Data-Extraction-in-Clinical-Trials/GPTProjectPaperFinal.pdf](https://brandonorodriguez.github.io/Leveraging-GPT-4o-for-Structured-Data-Extraction-in-Clinical-Trials/GPTProjectPaperFinal.pdf) <br>
I created this project myself from Nov-Dec using JupyterLab <br>
The data citation and full formal report is in __GPTProjectPaperFinal.pdf__ <br>
The Jupyter Notebooks used to extract all data is in __Test_Data_Extraction.ipynb__ and __Train_Data_Extraction.ipynb__ <br>
The Jupyter Notebooks used to summarize all accuracy metrics are in __Test_Data_Analysis.ipynb__ and __Train_Data_Analysis.ipynb__ <br>
The raw output parsed into csv files, is in __/test_data__ and __/train_data__ <br>
The final scored csv files for each study are in __/test_results__ and __/train_results__ <br>
The manually extracted datasets used to score the csv files are in __/results_excel__ <br>
